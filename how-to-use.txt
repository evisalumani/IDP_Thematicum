How to use:

1) Navigate into the folder (in the command line/ terminal)
2) Run "npm install" to install all required dependencies
3) Run "npm run build" to run the development build script => Keep this process running! It recompiles your files upon changes.
4) Run "npm start" in a new command line/ terminal window => Keep this process running as well, it's your NodeJS server. 

First, run mognodb:
- mongod â€”-dbpath db

To interact with mongo shell:
$ mongo
$ use thematicum
//thematicum is the name of the database, as is in the connection string in app.js
$ show collections
//e.g. users
$ db.users.find()
//to query the users collection
