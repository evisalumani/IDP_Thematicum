# Web app for crowdsourcing thematic investment data

The application was developed at the "Chair of Financial Management and Capital Markets" at TU MÃ¼nchen. It was built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB + Node.js + Express + Angular 2) and aims to improve the data gathering process
on the topic of thematic investing. 

### How to run:
To run this application locally (non-Dockerized):
1. Start the MongoDB database (from project root): `mongod --dbpath db`. The folder db must be previously created in the project root; otherwise, the --dbpath parameter can be left out and the default location will be used.
2. If this is the first time starting the database and no stock data is inserted, run this command (from /server/utilities) to insert some initial stock data: `mongo localhost:27017/thematicum stocksInsert.js`
3. Install dependencies of the Node.js server (from /server): `npm install`. Run the server as: `npm start`. If needed, the server environment variables can be modified in the `.env` file, based on the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package. The REST API from Express is running on `localhost:3000`. 
4. Install dependencies of the Angular app (from /angular-app): `npm install`. Run the app as: `ng serve`. The client app can be viewed on the browser on `localhost:4200`.
